The Present directory is intended to store files and content from the currently active Challenge cycle. Content of the Present directory changes frequently as the Challenge year progresses. Once a Challenge Cycle is complete, the content of the Present directory will be moved to the Past directory. A new challenge year usually starts as soon as the Expo Awards Ceremony is completed. The Present directory has many top level subdirectories:
Events
Team Deliverables
On-Going Activities
Miscellaneous



Examples of Events in Challenge Cycle:
- Summer Teacher Institute (sti) usually held in July
- Kick Off (ko) usually held in October
- Visits (Board Members and Challenge Volunteers can visit teams any time during the year, but usually between Kick Off and Expo Awards)
- Expo Awards usually in April


Examples of Team Deliverables due on designated deadline dates within in the Challenge Cycle:
- Problem Statement usually due at completion of Kick Off event
- Interim Report usually due in Dec - Jan time period (half-way point of the Challenge cycle)
- Final Report usually due the week before the Expo Awards


In addition to the described scheduled Events, there are On-Going Activities. 
On-Going activities are continuous and may or may not coincide with a regularly scheduled Challenge Eve

Examples of On-Going Activities:
- Financial (budgets, monthly income/expense reports, bank statements, tax forms)
- Fund Raising (outreach to state legislature, grant applications and sponsorship requests to local, regional, national funding sources, donations of "in-kind" resources)
- Correspondence (letters to and from teams, letters to and from sponsors, flyers, invitations to participate, notices, requirements or restrictions)
- Governance (business plans, by-laws, operational procedures, board member roster, board member conflict of interest forms, meeting minutes, legal notices)
- Facilitator Resources (curriculum ideas, presentations, handouts, lesson plans, exercises, team lists, mentors, contact info, checklists, judging rubrics)


Finally, to allow for the unexpected things we generate and collect, the Miscellaneous directory offers a catch-all place. Any Collaborator can store content here (preferably in named subdirectories) until we figure out the most appropriate place to archive it on a permanent basis.
