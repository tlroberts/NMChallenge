The Past directory is intended to store files and content from Challenge Events 
and On-Going activities from inactive Challenge cycles of the past. 
All content moves to the Past directory at the completion of a Challenge Cycle 
(after the Expo Awards Ceremony event).  

The Challenge Cycle is a yearly time period that starts with fund raising activities 
and preparation of the Summer Teacher Institute in the spring of a calendar year 
and ends in the spring of the subsequent year at the completion of the Expo Awards event.
